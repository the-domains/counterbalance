Capacity Marketing

Remember when you were a kid and the world was wide open.  The feeling of freedom to go from one thing to the next and over time you developed the a sense of risk vs.reward.  These self imposed limitations were build on your experience  of encouragement, success & failure.  Now in business, everyday we are challenged by new ideas, new way of doing things and you find yourself grasping for the open minded kid that once ruled your body, while your mind filled with experience screams something else.
